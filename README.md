My Fork of pyopencv
===================
Purpose
-------
The original one, whose repository was hosted on Google Code (which is going offline in Jan 2016), is not compatible with the current version of [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools), and so I'm doing my part to maintain it by applying [this fix](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24612021/python-setuptools-importerror-cannot-import-name-library).
Usage
-----
